This program works just like how tar and GNU works, except a partner
and I coded it from scratch. This version of tar has a listing feature
that lists all files and directories in a specified directory or file
system, a create feature that creates an archived file in the same format
that gnu tar does so that linux recognizes it as a compressed file, and an
extract feature that takes the compressed file and extracts it.
